        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="para">My hobby is reading youth fiction in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like
            to read such books after completing my home work. I am 13 years old and read in class 6th standard. Now I
            know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by
            anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of
            enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most
            importantly a successful person in the life.

        <h1>My Reading Journey</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="para">My reading journey started with the book "Goosebumps: Attack Of The Jack-O'-Lanterns by R.L
            Stine" i finished it in one day i loved it. Then my journey continued with the book "Magnus Chase And The
            Hammer Of Thor by Rick Riordan" the funny thing is that it's the second book in the trilogy but i liked it,
            so my Mom and Dad bought the next part the third book in the trilogy "Magnus Chase And The Ship Of The Dead
            by Rick Riordan" and the first book in the trilogy "Magnus Chase And The Sword Of Summer by Rick Riordan" i
            decided to read to read the third book in the trilogy and then i read the first one. After i finished the
            trilogy of Magnus Chase, my Dad bought another book "Spooksville: The Haunted Cave by Christopher Pike" in
            the series there are 25 books it was the third book, i loved it so my Dad bought the first book
            "Spooksville: The Secret Path by Christopher Pike" and the second book "Spooksville: The Howling Ghost by
            Christopher Pike" i fished both of them in 2 days, i will read the fourth soon.Then i bought "Goosebumps:
            Welcome To The Dead House" it was awsome and scary. Then i bought "The Subtle Knife by Phillp Pullman" this
            was the second book of a trilogy the first book was not available, so i tried reading the second book but it
            was related to the first one so i couldn't understand what was going on, so i kept it for a while and soon
            my Mom and Dad bought me the first book "The Golden Compass by Phillp Pullman" and the third book "The Amber
            Spyglass by Phillp Pullman" i completed the first one and i am planning to read the colector book of Magnus
            Chase "9 From The Nine Worlds". </p>
